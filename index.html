    <h2><center>Introduction<center></h2>
	    <p>Dear Reader:</p>
    <p>This website contains most of the essential information and documents for a possible employer to get an idea of who I am professionally. You will find that I’m quite a technology enthusiast, as my main career focus is in computer science and mathematics. In fact since I was little I was known for my curiosity of the subject, and a the years had passed that curiosity kept growing.</p>
	    <p>As the saying goes, “Find a job you love and you will never work a day,” and to me programming is exactly that. Nowadays I mainly work in a GNU/Linux environment using Emacs for fifty percent of the computing I do. I also upload all of my work on github.com through repositories I maintain in my machine with git.<br>
	    Other than that I have a great interest in literature and linguistics, which has led me to pursue an in-depth study of the English language, and improve my knowledge of my mother-tongue languages - Albanian and Italian. I’m also currently learning French, and I plan to get official language certificates soon.</p>
	    <p>After I graduate from highschool I plan to pursue an Undergraduate Degree in Pure Mathematics, and hopefully continue to my Masters Degree. I would also like to learn more functional programming languages than I already know, my particular interest being Lisp.</p>
	    <p>As you read this portfolio I hope you’ll find the right characteristics that can make me a valuable candidate for your available position.</p>
	    <p>Sincerely,</p>
	    <p>Giuseppe Di Mario<br>
