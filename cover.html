    <h2><center>Cover Letter<center></h2>
	    <p>May 23, 2018</p>
	    <p>Mr. Archer Sloane<br>
		University of Columbia<br>
		230 Jesse Hall<br>
		Columbia, MO 65211<br></p>
     <p>I’m writing this letter to let you know I would like to apply for an assistant position teacher at the Department of Mathematics at your university, as recommended to me by Professor John Williams, with whom you have collaborated in the past.<br>
I will be awarded my Master’s Degree in Pure Mathematics by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology just at the start of next month. Because of that I see this position as a perfect opportunity to apply the skills I have gained during the numeros years I have studied for my Ma degree, as I’m sure would benefit both of us.</p>
     <p>I come from a very diverse background: my mother is from Albania and my father is from Italy, and I was born in the latter. Because of that - and my father’s job as an international engineer for the firm Pilkington - I have travelled very often since I was little, and that has given me very strong adaptability skills. During my senior year of high school I also applied for an International Exchange School Program, which has given me the right attitude to lead a very efficient independent life. However, that doesn’t mean I lack the ability of eloquent communication and interaction with other people. On the contrary, I have financed my post-graduate studies mainly by assisting Professor Williams with his students and taking over a couple of his classes. That has given me a close relationship with many undergraduate students who view me as a sort of a mentor.</p>
     <p>I look forward to your response. I’ll contact you again shortly to make sure that your department has fully received my application. In case of any particular question I’m available at contact@gidm.info or +1 (315) 364-1766.</p>
	    <p>Sincerely,</p>
	    <p>Giuseppe Di Mario<br>
Po Box 297<br>
