		Hello,<br>
		Is there anybody in there?<br>
		Just nod if you can hear me.<br>
		Is there anyone at home?<br>
        <br></br>
		Come on now<br>
		I hear you're feeling down<br>
		Well, I can ease your pain<br>
		And get you on your feet again<br>
		<br></br>
		Relax<br>
		I'll need some information first<br>
		Just the basic facts<br>
		Can you show me where it hurts?<br>
		<br><br>
		There is no pain, you are receding<br>
		A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
		You are only coming through in waves<br>
		Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
		When I was a child I had a fever<br>
		My hands felt just like two balloons<br>
		Now I've got that feeling once again<br>
		I can't explain, you would not understand<br>
		This is not how I am<br>
		I have become comfortably numb<br>
		<br></br>
		I have become comfortably numb<br>
        <br></br>
		O.K.<br>
		Just a little pin prick<br>
		There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!<br>
		But you may feel a little sick<br>
		<br></br>
		Can you stand up?<br>
		I do believe it's working, good<br>
		That'll keep you going through the show<br>
		Come on, it's time to go.<br>
        <br></br>
		There is no pain you are receding<br>
		A distant ship smoke on the horizon<br>
		You are only coming through in waves<br>
		Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
		When I was a child<br>
		I caught a fleeting glimpse<br>
		Out of the corner of my eye<br>
		I turned to look but it was gone<br>
		I cannot put my finger on it now<br>
		The child is grown<br>
		The dream is gone<br>
		I have become comfortably numb.<br></font>
