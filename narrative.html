    <h3><center>Love Letters</center></h3>
    <p>To Jane Bouvier<br>
      23 Groening Street<br>
      Albany, NY</p>
    <p>Everyone's an addict. You might think you aren't but I know for a fact that you are. Don't worry, I myself hadn't realised I was one too. I was addicted, as many people other than me, to the ordinary. This is the story of how I kicked out this habit of mine.<br>
Nothing special was happening at the station so I decided to go out for a quick cigarette. I had just put the cigarette in my mouth when Francis, a colleague, grabbed my shoulder and whispered in a very embarrassed voice : "Oi mate, we just received a phone booth call, suggesting us, to check on an apartment on Steven Martin street..."<br>
"Oh come on! It's probably just another one of those kids trying to make a prank call!" I complained.<br>
"Yeah… But what can I tell you? It's the procedure, I'll write you the full address" he replied.<br>
And so I got in the car and started driving there. Who could have guessed that after four years of criminal justice school and two months of police academy I'd end up in this forgotten place called Pungkhaw just to occasionally help the same old ladies cross the streets and play along with some kids who have nothing better to do than prank call a police station? Oh well, that's just how life goes I guess. Anyway, I finally get to this place - a relatively small pink house in the suburbs of the town - and to get done with this as quickly as possible I immediately tried ringing the bell. No answer, so I tried opening the door in case it wasn't locked and, not to my surprise, it wasn't (it's such a small town that no-one keeps their house locked). However as soon as I was turning the door handle a not-so-pleasant smell invaded my nostrils. Inside the house was completely dark, if it wasn't for the light coming from the door I'd probably not be able to see a thing, but thanks god policemen have flashlights. I turned it on and started walking around the house, but the smell was getting unbearable, almost to the point of vomiting, fortunately a radio call distracted me from it. It was Francis, just calling to check that everything was alright.<br>
"I've got a bad feeling about this," I told him, trying to imitate Ewan McGregor's voice in a vain attempt to downplay what was happening. "But I'll let you know," I concluded without even noticing if he'd replied or not. <br>
      After a couple of minutes of just wandering around the house hopelessly trying to find what the source of that unpleasant odor was, my eyes glanced on a piece of a paper laying on the floor. I immediately pick it up and I quickly notice that there was something written on it. Not wanting to read it under the flashlight light, I went outside and slowly read its content:</p>
    <p><i>Dear whoever is going to read this letter, respectable police officer of the town of Pungkhaw,
by the time you read this you’ll probably be able to feel a very distinctive smell haunting the house. If you haven't already checked under the restroom sink, you'd find out, lying down there, is the corpse of Michael Burroughs. Now you might ask how do I know such a thing, but frankly, the answer is quite simple: I, Simon Curtis, am the murderer. But Before we start getting into details of that tragic (and glorious) moment, I feel some kind of moral obligations to let you know some of the backgrounds of this story. 
Since I can remember I had always been that 'attention-seeking' kid that desperately keeps trying to get approved by everyone, but now as an adult I had stopped caring about such things, probably a little bit too much, to the point I completely rejected human contact. At least until about three months ago. It was the 13th of November, it's already been over a year that I have lived here, but still haven't made anything even remotely close to a friend. I thought I didn't need one. Some weird music coming from my new neighbor apartment - he moved here on the 11th - caught my ears. It was almost hypnotic, so I decided to do the unthinkable. I decided to knock on their door. A young lad greeted me at the door and after I had politely introduced myself as the new neighbor he invited me to come inside. I did the unthinkable again, and accepted. Behind that door were guys and girls playing instruments that ranged from a piano to a sitar, all surrounded by pink, red, and purple light just flashing around the room. That guy, which I later learned he was called Michael, asked me if I could play any instrument. As soon as I said that I play the bass, he handed me a six-string fretless one. I was petrified, I didn't know what to say, but without me even realising I was already sitting near the members of this absurd band, having fun. Some hours had passed and most people were gone by now, except for me, Michael, and a guy sleeping on the couch. We still kept on playing for I don't know how many hours until we started asking each other a series of personal questions for no particular reasons, as though we were very good friends that hadn't seen each other in years. I knew exactly what kept me going. I was fascinated by this man, by its manners, by its voice and by the way he kept me entertained. For the first time in years I liked someone. 
I kept visiting every time I could to the point of turning myself back to a kid. I desired his attention, I craved it as it w something I couldn't live without, but I kept this feeling to myself, until that one night. He had invited me and a couple of other friends over to his to house to play some music, but - I have no idea why - I was the only one who showed up. After a while we just got tired of repeating the same notes over and over again, so we decided to put on a movie. I suggested that we watch ‘A Clockwork Orange' since I had just happened to finish the book the night before. During the scene where Alex is forced to keep his eyes open, we both instinctively looked away from the television, evidently we didn't like the feeling of watching a metallic thing going inside someone's eyes. By doing that, our glances met, and we discovered that, in fact, we do like each other's eyes. So this time we didn't look away. We kept on staring to the point it began to feel embarrassing, until of course, we kissed. In that moment,something really close to love was growing inside of me. However mine wasn't love, it was obsession. Obsession with everything he did, everywhere he went and everyone he was with. I began to think that that single, meaningless kiss, entitled me to be in control of him, and I still believe that, the only problem was, he didn't. 
I started checking his phone when he wasn't looking, using a binocular to spy on his house, keep track on a journal of every single thing that he did, even the smallest, so that I could always have an excuse to just randomly show up to his house when he less expected me, so that we'd a chance to always be together. Me and him, nobody else, like I know we both wanted to. Do you know how he thanked me for that? Do you have any idea of what I received for him as a ‘thank you, Simon, for all you've done'? A text message - yeah right, a stupid text message - just saying “stop it or I will tell the police.” Here we are then, I'm telling the police, are you happy Michael? But you're dead, aren't you? Are you happily dead at least? I bet you are, so let's go back to the night I killed you, just to prolong our reader's entertainment. 
I showed up at your door crying, and you didn't even have the decency to open the door. I had to break a window, what other choice did I have? I was happy to see that you were waiting for me, with a kitchen knife in your hand. However as soon as I did just a single step towards you, you threw it, hitting my leg. You couldn't move, and for a moment I couldn't either, but I managed to pick up the knife and just keep staring at it, for about a minute. Everything froze for an entire minute. You could have run away, as far as possible from me, but you didn't. You still desired me right? However you can't just switch side whenever you want to, you know? So I did it. A simple cut down your throat, that's all it took. Funny how simple it is to end a human life if you think about it.
      Now, at the very end, you might wonder why did I even write this letter? What's the point of even admitting to have committed such a crime? The point is, dear reader, I wanted to take credit for it. From the moment that we kissed he became mine, and I and only I had the right to choose if he lived or died.</i></p>
    <p><i>Best regards</i></p>
    <div class="one">
      <p><i>Simon Curtis</i></p>
    </div>
    <p><i>P.S. Just a friendly advice, don't even waste your time trying to find me, I'd probably be dead anyway.</i></p>
    <p>I kept staring at this piece of paper for almost five minutes, terrified of the possibility of its content being even remotely true. I got back to reality as soon as I noticed a police car coming my way. It was Francis. He probably came here because I ignored the radio.<br>
As he got out of his car and was approaching me he shouted: “What's your problem mate? Is everything alright?"<br>
I remained silence.<br>
"What's with this awful smell?" He continued anyway. "Come on Will is everything okay?".<br>
I didn't answer, instead I just gave him the piece of paper without even looking at him. Now more officers and even the sheriff came at the scene but I still couldn't do anything. You might think that I shouldn't be impressed by such a thing because of my profession, and I thought that too. I wanted more out of it, but when it finally arrived, I wasn't prepared.<br>
I was exactly like Simon, I desperately wanted to get out of the ordinary that when it finally happened I completely lose my mind. However I didn't want to become like him, so I had to act fast. I quitted my job the next day and just ran away, as far as possible from anything that I could consider usual.<br>
Now, after fifteen years, nobody has ever found Simon nor his body, and nobody has found me either.<br>
      That's why I'm writing this letter, dear mother. To let at least someone know that I'm still alive and to expose the reasons of my departure, but ,most importantly, I want you to share my story so that anyone could read it, and learn by my unusual experience.</p>
    <p>Your tryly<br>
      William Simpson</p>
    <p>P.S.<br>
      I'm sorry I've never contacted you after that day, I hope you understand.</p>
