    <h2><center>Letter of Recommendation<center></h2>
    <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p><br>
    <p>It has been a great pleasure having Giuseppe Di Mario in my Calculus class this year. Giuseppe is a very talented mathematics student who will surely be successful in his future studies. I look forward to seeing him develop into an outsatnding mathematician.</p>
    <p>Giuseppe has had a successful year in Calculus. His attendatce is superb and he is always prepared. Giuseppe's work is well organized, legible and done with greate care. Throughout the course of the year, it ha become clear that the Italiam mathematics curriculum doesn not rely on technology the way that our New York State curriculum does. As a result, Giuseppe's understanding of functions is much stronger than his classmates. This is a great benefit to him as the study of calculus relies greatly on a deeper understanding of how functions behave. Giuseppe is often successful in solving authentic math problems; he is fluent at modeling real life mathematics problems with calculus.</p>
    <p>Giuseppe is a very personable and pleasant young man. He is very well mannered and kind. He is willing to work with others, share is ideas, and receive constructive criticism in return. These qualities paired with his international experience and vast intellect will make him an outstanding candidate for universities and career opportunities. I look forward to seeing where his studies at Sandy Creek Central School lead him next. I am very appreciative of the opportunity to teach Giuseppe and proud to say that he is a Sandy Creek Student.</p><br>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
      Katie Soluri</p>
