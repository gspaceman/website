    <h2><center>Self Reflection</center></h2>
    <p>
I will always remember my first day of high school. In fact I had three of those particular - yet scary - experiences.<br>
As of today, I’m writing this document as an exchange student in Sandy Creek High School, but my scholastic career has started across the Atlantic Ocean, all the way to a little town on the Italian east coast. I had done both elementary and middle school in my very small hometown, to then start high school in the very same place. After half of the 9th grade had already passed, I decided that I was done. I couldn’t bear to spend another school year in the same place I’ve been for fourteen year: so I applied to a different school in a different town for 10th grade. Everything initially was exciting and such, but after a while it simply got back to that usual, boring “normality.”<br>
All this taught me - or at least I thought so - that I must have certainly been doing something wrong, so I figured that since going to school in a different town hadn’t worked out so well, I should just try to change continent. And here I am, thousands of mile away from home enjoying this experience, but has something really changed? Of course, something must have changed. I met new people, visited interesting places, survived the winter, etc, etc…  Yet, when it comes down to school, fundamentally, nothing much has changed. <br>
So, what’s the problem here? Should I just drop school and go around the world in some kind of crazy romantic adventure, just to break out of the routine and never be bored again? It might seem logical, but the answer is no, for two reasons. The first is that it would be way too impractical for me to attempt such a thing, and the second is that it probably won’t be the best solution.<br>
“The best solution to a problem, is usually the easiest one,” and in fact, in this case, it is. It might seem obvious or a little cliche, but the answer to all my problems, was not to change my surroundings, but to change my attitude: even if one moves to a different town, makes new friends and have new experiences, nothing will change until he realises that nothing will change, until he first changes himself.
