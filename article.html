	    <h3><center>Art Club</center></h3>
    <p>Art, as defined by the Oxford Dictionary, is "the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power." However a simple flat definition can't describe what the art club here at Sandy Creek High School is. This club is coordinated by our school art teacher, Mr Scoville who, inspired by his previous teaching experiences in other institutes, wanted to "create a culture where anyone interested in art can join and feel part of a bigger cohesive group." It was first established in 2003 when he first started to teach in our town, and since then things have remained almost the same.<br> 
Every other Thursday the club meets in the art room where its members are free to use any equipment to be as creative as they want. Some would just simply take a pencil and start drawing, some others would go a step further and utilise paint, while other people would even try to make a clay sculpture. Its current members are Emily Ward, Ruby Scoville, Evelyn Bice (from ninth grade), Roselyne Sprague (from tenth grade), Jadyn Mullin, Jordyn Mullin, Colbyn Dinehart, Jonas Fizette, Margery Yousey, Violet Carkey, Caleigh Rosenbaum, Eric Kennedy, Violet Graf (from eleventh grade), Gavin James, Giuseppe Di Mario, Clarice Miller, Trace Clark, Madalin Vescera, Ethan Graf (from twelfth grade). Violet Carkey told us she "really enjoys the concept of the club" and has offered her "a great opportunity to do what I enjoy while feeling like a part of a bigger group."<br> 
In preparation for Halloween the club organised a "Bad Movie Night," where people could come and purposely watch a terrible movie - Night of the Lepus - just for the pure enjoyment of having fun while criticising it. By selling some sodas and popcorn that night they started fund raising some money for the upcoming Boston trip that the club will do later this year. On this matter Erik Kennedy commented: "I really look forward to this trip as I'm sure it's going to be a fantastic opportunity to see different places and learn new things." </p>
