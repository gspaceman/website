    <h2><center>Argumentative Essay<center></h2>
    <h3><center>Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?</center></h3>
    <p>"The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing".<br>
Since the first time I had heard this quote in "Trainspotting", I've been fascinated by its meaning.<br>
We live our lives taking too many things for granted, things that would have been impossible to even imagine in the past. Do you need a fast way to travel from one place to another? Take a plane. Do you need to do quick research? Just use a search engine. Something big has happened and you want to know more? Just wait ten minutes and some major tv/web company will have already covered the event. As I said, those things would have been almost unthinkable in the past, and, although you might think that what I'm saying is the most obvious thing in the world, we don't really seem to notice that.<br>
      We don't really seem to acknowledge the fact that everything around us is in constant change and to keep up with that, we must change too.</p>
    <p> This concept of personal growth is what inspired me to leave almost everything behind and come to the United States for my last year of high school. I have chosen this country because I dare to say that my knowledge of the English language is fairly good, and, most importantly, because its portrayal had always captivated me. The so-called "American Dream", the opportunity of turning your life upside-down has inspired me and so many other people of all races and nationalities to come here to achieve their goals, but what exactly is mine? My goal, as you may have anticipated, is to change and inspire change in others. I want to be able to express my opinions as creatively as possible, while still being credible. Some people consider creativity and credibility as separate, even opposite subjects. However in my experience, I've found that the most credible people are the ones who are able to reach to your emotions in the most creative way possible. The moment I realized that, was the moment my passion for journalism began. In journalism I found the best method of, as I would say it, describing the subjective as objectively as possible. Some people may recognize some journalists only from their writing style, and this greatly contributes to prove my point that no matter how objective you try to be, you will always leave your creative stamp on your works. I've decided that I want to become one of them, one of those authors who get recognized simply by their style. A very ambitious goal I must admit, but not an impossible one. My interest in journalism has also been greatly influenced by another one of my passions, photography, especially the now-old thirty-five millimeters cameras.</p>
 <p>Freeze reality and then build a story around that moment. That is the essence of what I want to do, but what's the point of writing a story if there are no readers? That's when journalism perfectly mixes with my needs. I will write for everyone who wants to read, for everyone who wants to see, who wants to have confirmation of a change in his or her own life. Before that, of course, I need to improve my journalistic skills, and I think the most secure way I'd be able to do that is by studying the subject in college. The decision to come to the United States has turned into the launch pad of what is going to be the longest journey of my life, and only by giving the best of my abilities can I try to reach the end.</p>
