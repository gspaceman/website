    <h4><center>Introduction</center></h4>
    <p>Standardized testing is everywhere. From first to twelfth grade, from school to work, and from America to Europe. It is so common that almost anyone in the United States has had in some point of their life, a standardized test. Even so, to fully understand its popularity, we have to start from its definition. What exactly is standardized testing? In laymans'term, as the name might suggest, standardized tests (in school) are a form of evaluation which has been proven by a trusted organization to be effective in calculating a student's performance. For example, let's just pretend that there's a college who has two scholarship candidates, but only one scholarship to give. The first candidate has never taken any standardized test and, as proof of his abilities, has only a couple of tests his chemistry teacher gave him. On the other hand, the other person has taken both the SAT and ACT (two of the most popular college admission tests). Regardless of the results or their individual ability, there's a very good chance that the college is going to pick the second one, even if the first one might have gotten better skills than the second. "Why is that?", you might ask. The answer is relatively easy: one can prove his ability, the other cannot. In other words, what are they going to trust? A couple of tests from a teacher no one's heard of, or some examinations from the biggest organizations regarding college entrance in the country? Of course, they are going to trust the latter. The point of this heavy reductio ad absurdum is to illustrate the great benefit of efficiency that standardized tests give, and which make them so popular. On paper, it all sounds like a great idea, but in reality, although standardized testing is a very great tool to measure the performance of a big group on a specific subject, it is not quite so effective when evaluating single individuals.</p>
    <h4><center>History and Main Problem</h4>
    <p>Before getting into the details of the problem, let's go back in time and see when and why was standardized testing so widely adopted. Lelac Almagor, in his article titled The Good in Standardized Testing, writes that before the 2001 mandatory introduction of standardized testing in schools, students didn't have any way of testing their abilities compared to other children in the states. In other words, what happened is that even though you might have been the best student in your entire class, got straight As, have a perfect attendance and all those other things that are used to define a good pupil, you might have gotten a very low score on - using the author's example - an entrance examination for an elite magnet high school. Why is that? The unfortunate answer is that without an imposed standard, schools had total control over what they taught and, unfortunately,  very often it wasn't enough. It all changed when President George W. Bush passed the No Child Left Behind act in 2001, which made standardized testing compulsory for every school. Compared to what we had prior to this law, this was a major improvement, but definitely not a flawless one. The biggest issue is that it assumed, and still assumes, that every student is the same, and that every student is fully evaluated by the exact same test. On one hand, some might argue that it is, in fact, true because if the test is the same, then there aren't any advantages for anyone. This reasoning, however, still assumes that everyone approaches these tests the same way everybody else does, and the only reason that someone might get a low or high grade, is the effort or study they put in it. That is simply not true. As of many great writers can be terrible public speakers, many students have different methods of expressing their abilities. Adding to that, a study described in Working Within The System: The Effects of Standardized Testing on Education Outreach and Community Writing, an article by Elizabeth Parfitt and Stephen Shane, how student’s approach to those test is usually very different from how they might have already learned in school. For example, another article titled The Emphasis of Student Test Scores in Teacher Appraisal Systems, by William C. Smith and Katarzyna Kubacka, argues that the main influence teacher have on their students, in relation of standardized test performance, is how they praise them for their results. This means that even something as variable as this, can have a big influence on someone's performance. On top of that, another simple, more obvious criticism, is that sometimes it can all just depend on luck. Without getting much into details, it is a fact that in multiple-choice questions (which usually give 4 options), you have a 1/4 chance of getting the answer right, and that is a relatively high possibility.</p>
    <h4><center>Second Problem</center></h4>
    <p>Another main problem of modern standardized testing is the monopoly that some organization have on them, and especially how they treat your data. For example, an article written by Zan Crowder and Stephanie Konle, called Gumbo Ya-Ya or, What Pearson Can’t Hear, exposes this problem in relation to Pearson, one of the biggest companies in school books and standardized testing. They write that during the time of a PARCC exam in New Jersey, Pearson was compulsory checking students' profile on social-medias and monitoring their online conversation to keep them from passing newly aligned Common Core standardized tests. Their excuse is that they are required by law, for security reasons, to do as such, however, these exact measures remain “proprietary secret” in some states, contributing to defend their lack of transparency as if "they were state secrets." However, you might say that, ethical dilemmas aside, if you don't like the way they treat your privacy, just don't take the exam, or take another one. That sounds so simple and immediate, but the reality is much more complicated than that. First of all, the PARCC is mandatory in some states, so you don't really have any choice, but even ignoring that, let's look at some non-mandatory (or at least, not in the full extent of the definition) examinations, such as the SAT and the ACT. Although you don't have to take them in order to apply for a college, they’ve managed to create such a huge monopoly that they are required by almost every college or university. That means that they can practically do anything with their tests or their participants, and you have to stick with it, simply because you have no concrete alternative. On top of that, they don't really treat your personal information any way better than Pearson does. For instance, they sell a great deal of your personal information through their "Student Search Service," mainly to not-so-known colleges. Using a personal life anecdote, I found it really unpleasing, or should I say, irritating, when a lot of colleges, especially smaller and very distant ones, started sending me emails with a list of precompiled information about myself. Apparently, there is a way to block those emails, but it is not immediate and not easily accessible to everyone.</p>
    <h4><center>Possible Solution and Why It Is Not Possible to Just Get Rid of Standardized Testing</center></h4>
    <p> With that said, some people believe that we should just opt out of standardized testing in favour of an even more reliable and efficient system. One of these people is Patricia Carini, who, as described in Descriptive Inquiry as an Alternative to Standardized Testing: Patricia Carini and Her Progressive Philosophy, an article by Yoshie Kittaka, believes in "Descriptive Inquiry, an educational approach to children based on a progressive philosophy." In short, this method is "a general term for a set of inquiring processes which share a common structure. Processes that comprise Descriptive Inquiry include but are not limited to the Descriptive Review of the Child, the Descriptive Review of Children's Works, the Descriptive Review of Curriculum, and the Descriptive Review of Teacher Practice." The problem with this kind of evaluation, however, is that it can be extremely subjective, and not really efficient (especially timewise) when evaluating a large group of students. That is why standardized testing, cannot, and probably will never be replaced. It is then quite obvious that the solution to this system's flaws, can't be resolved by just eliminating the problem in the first place. Instead, the most reasonable solution is that of gradually changing it, to always improve its precision on an even larger group of people.</p>
    <h4><center>Proposed Solution and Conclusion</center></h4>
    <p>The questions now are: "what can we do to achieve that?", and "how can we make the change gradual?" A big improvement that could really benefit standardized testing in the United States is the use of more oral tests. Most classes in school hardly ever rely on this method, even though being able to verbally express your ideas should be an essential skill, instead of just crossing one of four option. Another major improvement, which would be the best way to make a change, is to give power back to schools. In 2001 George W. Bush with the No Child Left Behind act, had fundamentally executed a good idea, but his biggest flaw was that he gave the power to control standardized testing not to schools, but to third-party, private companies. On the other hand, across the Atlantic Ocean, most European countries have already given full control of testing to their school, and with government regulation and control, they have successfully set a nation's standard. Following this model, the United States educational system would gain a huge improvement, both economically (everything would happen in the same place and by the same people running the school) and performance wise. The smartest - and most obvious - thing to do, would then be to shift the control of standardized testing back to schools.</p>

    <div class="one">
      <p>In this piece, the author, Lelac Almagor, discusses what are the actual benefits that make standardized testing so widely used today. Using a mixture of his experience as a student and his teaching career, Almarog delivers a very effective argument in favour of the use of this quite controversial testing method. I will use this article as a proof of the effectiveness of standardized testing. </p>

    <div class="two">
      <p>This article, by two professors from the University of Carolina, explores a very uncommon topic regarding standardized testing, that of Pearson Publishing digitally spying on children to prevent them from passing along Common Core standardized test questions and to discredit the "opt-out of standardized testing movement." This could be a very interesting source to help explain a not-really-known subject to most readers.</p>

      <p>Standardized testing is continuously being criticised for being a flat and mechanical way of evaluating a person, yet it seems like there isn't a more efficient way to do such a thing. However, Yoshie Kitakka might disagree: she believes in Descriptive Inquiry,"an educational approach to children based on a progressive philosophy." This is belief is based on the idea that every human is different, so there is no way that a standardized alternative could be really efficient for everyone. This article might be helpful when listing the pros and cons of standardized testing.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, a thing may be considered bad simply because of people approaching it in the wrong way. The authors seem to think that the same thing may have happened to standardized testing. In fact, Emerson College students were asked to tutor 10th graders from Boston Public School, and in doing that, they completely changed students' approach to standardized writing tests by making them recognize their own writing as an empowered and meaningful political form of social action. I'll be able to use this source as a proof that standardized testing isn't necessarily a bad thing.</p>

    <div class="five">
      <p>Homeschooling, especially nowadays, has been and is a very controversial topic of discussion. However, putting opinions aside, the author of this article has decided to verify the effectiveness of this method of education by analyzing the results of homeschooled children on an ACT Mathematics Achievement Test. I can use this article in order to address the "home-schooling" part of my paper.</p>

      <p>Standardized test is not just a tool to easily evaluate a student's performance on a subject, it is also a way for teachers to give some kind of feedback to their pupils. However, the authors argue that although this might seem a very immediate and effective method, it could actually lead students to a more stressful state of mind: that is why I am going to use this article in relations to the "students under stress" subtopic.</p>
